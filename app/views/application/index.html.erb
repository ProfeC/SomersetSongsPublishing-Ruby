                  <h1>Welcome to the Music of Foreigner</h1>
                  <p>On this site you will find information about all songs written and performed by Foreigner. Please feel free to browse for music ideas. No sign-in is needed.</p>
                  <p>A few facts of interest about the songs: 1-stop clearance is available as the majority of the songs are 100% owned and controlled by Somerset Songs for the world. The songs are pre-cleared and available for immediate approval. Lyric change request(s), though not encouraged, will be considered. Foreigner also owns master record(ing)s of many of the songs and both masters and songs can be cleared with a single request.</p>
