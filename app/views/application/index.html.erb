                  <h1>Welcome to the Music of Foreigner</h1>
                  <p>Here you will find numerous major hit songs and recognizable hidden gems created by Songwriter Hall of Fame writers and performed by Foreigner. Please feel free to explore the unique music and hooks that are the hallmarks of the Foreigner genre. No sign-in is needed.</p>
                  <p>A few facts of interest about the catalog:  Clearance is easy and fast. The majority of the songs are 100% owned and controlled by Somerset Songs for the world. The songs are pre-cleared and available for immediate approval. Lyric change requests, though not encouraged, will be considered. Foreigner also owns master recordings of many of the songs and both master and publishing rights can be cleared with a single request. Metadata is provided for each song.</p>
